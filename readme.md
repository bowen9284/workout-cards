# Workout Cards

Inspired by a type of workout I have done, each card from a standard deck of cards represents an exercise.

Once logged in to the application, a user can view a list of existing workouts or create a new one from a pre-populated drop downs.

Once a workout is selected, click start to begin the workout. After each exercise is completed, press next until you get through the entire deck.
